# bin



One-off scripts to make life a little easier.

Simple enough to not warrant release as a separate CLI.

## Supported Platforms

- MacOS

## Prerequisites

- Homebrew
- Modern Ruby

## Set Up

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the needed dependencies
    - MacOS w/ Homebrew: `brew bundle`
3. Add the cloned repo location to your PATH
4. Reload your shell
5. Run the scripts!

## Notes

Most of these are in Ruby because I know Ruby well and think it's great for these kind of scripts.
